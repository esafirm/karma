## Karma

A library that provide an opinionated way to create Android app with MVI pattern.
It supports React's-ish time travel debugging and diff render.

## Gradle

In your root `build.gradle`

```groovy
allprojects {
  repositories {
    ...
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
  }
}
```

In your module `build.gradle`

```groovy
dependencies {
  final karmaVersion = "1.3.0"
  implementation "com.github.esafirm.karma:karma-core:$karmaVersion"
  implementation "com.github.esafirm.karma:karma-renderer:$karmaVersion"
  implementation "com.github.esafirm.karma:karma-timetravel:$karmaVersion"
  implementation "com.github.esafirm.karma:karma-timetravel-dashboard:$karmaVersion"
}
```

## Modules

The library currently separated into four modules:

1. Core
2. Renderer
3. Time Travel
4. Time Travel Dashboard

If we create a dependency tree, it would look like this:

```
        core
      ___/\___
     /        \
renderer     time travel
                \
            time travel dashboard
```

- `core` module is standalone
- `renderer` needs core
- `time travel` needs core
- `time travel dasboard` needs core & time travel

## Usage

### Core

Karma core introduce how you can create an MVI-ish application with minimal setup.

To create a screen, what you need is:

1. A State
2. A Presenter
3. An Android Component to bind it all together

State refer to a **view state**. For example we have this simple state

```kotlin
data class SimpleScreenState(
  val textLineOne: String,
  val textLineTwo: String
)
```

Presenter is a place that we call all our action that change a state.

```kotlin
class SimplePresenter : UiPresenter<SimpleScreenState>(action) {

  override fun initialState() = SimpleScreenState("a", "b")

  // We change textLineOne and retain our current textLineTwo
  fun changeLineOne(text: String) = setState {
    copy(textLineOne = text)
  }
}
```

To initialize Karma, you need to now os how to bind all the component together

```kotlin
fun <S, P : KarmaPresenter<S>> bind(
  lifecycleOwner: LifecycleOwner,
  viewModelStoreOwner: ViewModelStoreOwner,
  presenterCreator: () -> P,
  render: (S, P) -> Unit
)
```

And this is an example of `Karma.bind` called in `AppCompatActivity`

```kotlin
Karma.bind(
  lifecycleOwner = this,
  viewModelStoreOwner = this,
  presenter = { SimplePresenter() },
  render = { state, presenter ->
    // do render
  }
)
```

Or, we could use the extension function to make it more simple

```kotlin
bind(
  presenter = { SimplePresenter() },
  render = renderer::render
)
```

### Renderer

Renderer enable us to control on how we can render state

```kotlin
renderer<State, Presenter> {
  init {
    // This will only called once.
    // Could be used to intialize some views or setup the listener
  }

  diff(State::data) {
    // This will only be called when state.data is changed
  }
	
  event(State::event) {
    // This will use special state called SingleEvent<E> that have internal flag
	// This can be used for notification state (ex: show toast)
  }

  always {
    // This will be always called
  }
}
```
